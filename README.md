## What Can It Be Used For?
It can be used to stream the frequency of someones name in the most recent tweets about that person. And it is setup
to send OSC messages with that data.

## Setup
To run the streaming, you can simply run `$python Assignment5.py` and this will start the streaming. In order to set it 
up with Wekinator I also have the file Assignment5Train.py which I used to train. I just changed the message_to_send
variable so that I could train different classes before I started the streamer. 

I used http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/twitter-analytics/ as a reference to learn how to stream tweets with
python
